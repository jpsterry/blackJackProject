# blackJackProject
So far:<br>
-The card, player, and deckBuilder class are fully functional<br>
-The program is able to deal cards with a layered JPanel<br>
-The program is able to populate a deck, pull images for the cards and display cards on the GUI<br>
-The only functional button right now is the Bet button which takes an input in the text field and augments the pot amount based on your bet<br>
-There is a small issue with the while loop which breaks the game. I am working on a fix for it.
To-do:<br>
-Add functionality to the rest of the buttons<br>
-Finish the game logic flow<br>
-add the ability to select a number of decks at the beginning of the game<br>
-add a cleanup function that restores all players to a normal state at the end of the game<br>
-move the while loop to a better location<br>
-refine the code and address any bugs
